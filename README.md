Second day:
  - Plants can now be spawned by clicking spawn plant button!
  - Timer used to have plant grow over time
  - Added health bar for plants to keep track of how watered they are


First day of developing:
  - Created prototype plant and room assets
  - Spent too long figuring out how to do drag and drop on plant plot
